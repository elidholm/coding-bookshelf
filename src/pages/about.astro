      <h2>Why I Created This Site</h2>
      <p>
        As a professional in software development, DevOps, and machine learning, I'm constantly reading to stay
        updated with the latest technologies and best practices. This site serves as my digital reading journal,
        where I document insights, key takeaways, and personal reflections on the technical books I read.
      </p>
      <p>
        By sharing these notes publicly, I hope to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a personal reference for concepts I might need to revisit</li>
        <li>Help others decide which books might be worth their time</li>
        <li>Contribute to knowledge sharing in the tech community</li>
        <li>Improve my own understanding through the process of summarizing and explaining</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>How I Structure My Notes</h2>
      <p>
        For each book, I typically include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A brief summary of the book's main ideas</li>
        <li>Key concepts and takeaways</li>
        <li>Code examples when applicable</li>
        <li>My personal rating and recommendation</li>
        <li>How I've applied (or plan to apply) the knowledge in my work</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are personal notes rather than comprehensive summaries or reviews. They reflect what I found
        most valuable or interesting, which might differ from what others take away from the same material.
      </p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable systems. My areas of interest include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Software architecture and design patterns</li>
        <li>DevOps practices and cloud infrastructure</li>
        <li>Machine learning and data engineering</li>
        <li>Programming languages and paradigms</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe in continuous learning and the power of sharing knowledge. This site is one way I contribute
        to the broader tech community while organizing my own thoughts and learnings.
